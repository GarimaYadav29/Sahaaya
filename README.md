# 🌱 Sahaaya

**Sahaaya** is a kind and helpful platform that connects people who want to **donate extra food, books, or clothes** with those who really need them. Instead of letting good things go to waste, Sahaaya helps them reach the right hands.

---

## 💡 What does it do?

Sahaaya lets people:
- Donate **leftover food** from homes or restaurants
- Give away **books** they no longer use
- Share **clothes** that are still in good condition

And on the other side, it helps **needy individuals or NGOs** discover and collect these useful items easily.

---

## ⚙️ How does it work?

1. Donors log in and **post** what they want to give (food, clothes, or books).
2. The platform makes this post **visible to nearby NGOs or individuals**.
3. Interested people can **connect with the donor** and collect the item.
4. Simple, useful, and community-driven.
