            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Sahaaya is an initiative designed to bring positive change by connecting resources that would 
                otherwise go to waste with individuals and communities that need them the most. Our platform 
                facilitates the seamless distribution of surplus food, clothing, and books to underprivileged 
                sections of society. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to reduce waste while creating an ecosystem of sharing and support. With the 
                combined effort of our donors and recipients, we aim to build a more equitable and sustainable 
                society.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>To create a world where no resource goes to waste and everyone has access to essential needs.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To connect surplus resources to those in need, fostering a culture of sharing and mutual support.</p>
